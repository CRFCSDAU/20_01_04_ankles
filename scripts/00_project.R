# Notes from investigator June 15, 2020

# I`m sorry for the delay in sending the data for analysis, the last patient was
# recruited in CUH on Thursday 11th, and I received their data late on Friday.
# We have recruited 160 patients in total, 140 from UHW and 20 from CUH. Our
# planned number was 140, but CUH started recruitment two months ago, and we had
# to introduce a new block of 20 to accommodate CUH.
#
# I have attached the data folder, the first section in yellow include patients
# characteristics, hospital stay and complications rate. This is our main focus
# for the coming annual review.
#
# Each follow-up point has a different colour starting from 2 weeks to 1 year.
# Our primary outcome is OMAS score at six weeks, if you have the time it will
# be great to include OMAS and SF-36 for two weeks and six weeks follow up. As
# the data is incomplete, we can do available case analysis rather than
# imputation this time if that makes things easier!. The deadline for annual
# review submission is Friday 26th , it will be great if I could have few days
# before that to interpreted the results.
#
# Don`t worry about x-ray findings and surgical site check columns, and I have
# included all detected complications in the complication column. Also, we will
# not analyse return to work for now.
#
# You might be aware that we have submitted the trial protocol for publication
# in a peer-reviewed Journal (Trials), one of the reviewers has commented on our
# statistical plan, as very basic and claimed that our sample size calculation
# is wrong (146 instead of 140). That might be to my beginner level in
# statistics but I used STATA to calculate the sample size and I think she made
# an error in adding the 20% drop-out !. Of note, she is not a statistician. I
# would appreciate if you could please read her comments and feel free to adjust
# the statistical analysis plan as you think yourself appropriate. Any way we
# need a new calculation as the total number now is 160. I will be resubmitting
# to the journal once I have your replay, this is not urgent.
#
# I have attached the full trial protocol for your reference if you need it,
# also attached the statistical protocol plan and the reviewer comments in one
# document.

# To finalize calculation of sample size, as we discussed we would like to
# achieve our target by May 2020 due to many reasons. This is my
# finalcalculation: To detect a clinically significant 10 points difference on
# the Olerud and Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) at 6 weeks with a standard
# deviation of 19. Alpha = 0.05 and Î²=0.20 (80% power), two-sided test and a
# maximum loss of follow up of 20 %, a sample size of 70 per each group is
# necessary.

# Dec 16

# We are currently halfway through a randomised controlled study comparing
# post-operative management of ankle fractures. We are approaching our target
# number at UHW, and we hope to start recruitment in CUH and GUH soon as we
# already granted ethical approval from CUH and GUH.
#
# We would appreciate your support and specifically, statistical support for
# this research. Further help in providing a research nurse to help the research
# team at CUH will be appreciated.

                                                                                                                                                                             Given the fact that I don`t want to increase sample size more than 140, I have two questions;
                                                                                                                                                                             1.	Is adding 20% loss of follow up necessary in the initial calculation as we will include everyone who is randomised to the analysis (ITT)?
                                                                                                                                                                               2.	I can increase the power to 87% by removing the 20% loss of follow up in the initial calculation. Which one is more important ?
